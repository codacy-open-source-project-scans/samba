Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.20.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.20 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

New Minimum MIT Krb5 version for Samba AD Domain Controller
-----------------------------------------------------------

Samba now requires MIT 1.21 when built against a system MIT Krb5 and
acting as an Active Directory DC.  This addresses the issues that were
fixed in CVE-2022-37967 (KrbtgtFullPacSignature) and ensures that
Samba builds against the MIT version that allows us to avoid that
attack.

Removed dependency on Perl JSON module
--------------------------------------

Distributions are advised that the Perl JSON package is no longer
required by Samba builds that use the imported Heimdal.  The build
instead uses Perl's JSON::PP built into recent perl5 versions.

Current lists of packages required by Samba for major distributions
are found in the bootstrap/generated-dists/ directory of a Samba
source tree.  While there will be some differences - due to features
chosen by packagers - comparing these lists with the build dependencies
in a package may locate other dependencies we no longer require.
