Release Announcements
=====================

This is the first pre release of Samba 4.21.  This is *not*
intended for production environments and is designed for testing
purposes only.  Please report any defects via the Samba bug reporting
system at https://bugzilla.samba.org/.

Samba 4.21 will be the next version of the Samba suite.


UPGRADING
=========


NEW FEATURES/CHANGES
====================

LDB no longer a standalone tarball
----------------------------------

LDB, Samba's LDAP-like local database and the power behind the Samba
AD DC, is no longer available to build as a distinct tarball, but is
instead provided as an optional public library.

If you need ldb as a public library, say to build sssd, then use
 ./configure --private-libraries='!ldb'

This re-integration allows LDB tests to use the Samba's full selftest
system, including our knownfail infrastructure, and decreases the work
required during security releases as a coordinated release of the ldb
tarball is not also required.

This approach has been demonstrated already in Debian, which is already
building Samba and LDB is this way.

As part of this work, the pyldb-util public library, not known to be
used by any other software, is made private to Samba.

LDB Module API Python bindings removed
--------------------------------------

The LDB Modules API, which we do not promise a stable ABI or API for,
was wrapped in python in early LDB development.  However that wrapping
never took into account later changes, and so has not worked for a
number of years.  Samba 4.21 and LDB 2.10 removes this unused and
broken feature.
